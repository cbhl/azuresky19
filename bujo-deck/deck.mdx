# Bullet Journaling
## (A Brief Guide)

---

# The Bullets

- . Task
- x Completed
- ~~- Obsolete~~
- o Event
- \- Note

---

# Start Simple

- Pen and paper.
- TODO: Image
- Try it for a few days.

```notes
Goal: Focus on doing fewer things: the things that are most important.
Goal: See if BuJo sparks joy for you.
Goal: Create enough time to set up your BuJo.
```

---

# Rapid Logging

- Write just enough to remind you.
- Short bullets: easier to read.
- More time doing stuff.

```notes
Goal: to be a functional adult who gets things done.

Tool needs to be fast and easy to use. Otherwise you're wasting time you could
use to get things done.

Example.

Writing concisely takes practice. (Also useful for writing emails at work, and
writing a resume.) Done is better than perfect! Okay if your tasks are a bit
verbose at the beginning.

Long-form journaling is theraputic. Feel free to do this in notes, or even in
separate entries in your bullet journal.

# Migration
- Rewrite things until we get them done or they become irrelevant.

# Basic BuJo Structure

- Index
- Future Log
- Monthly Log
- Daily Log

---

# Basic BuJo Structure

- Start at the first blank spread.
- Number each page as you use it.

---

# Index

- Future Log: 5-9
- Jan: 10-
- Drawings: 15, 19

---

# Index

- Start at the first blank spread.
- Four pages. Number each page, starting at 1.
- Heading, in block letters, at the top center of each page.
- Abbr. each month.
- Keep current month open-ended (leave the hanging dash).
- Always want to have more space to journal if you need it.

---

# Future Log

- Front of the journal. Right after the index.
- Three-month example.
- Stores entries with date outside the current month.

---

# Monthly Log

- Calendar page. (left page)
- Dates, day of week down left side.
- Tasks page. (right page)
- Think about what you want to get done this month.
- Migrate tasks from previous month's daily logs.
- Migrate tasks from future log.

---

# Daily log

- Add date and page number. Done!
- Rapid log as thoughts come up during the day. Then you can focus on the task at hand.
- Use as much space as that day needs.
- Don't set up way ahead of time. Create the day of or the night before.

---

# The Habit

- AM: Plan
  - What do I want to get done today? Write in your daily log.
- PM: Reflect and Update
  - What did I get done today? Update bullets to reflect task status.
  - What do I want to get done tomorrow? Write in your daily log.
- Monthly: Migration.
  - Cross off incomplete tasks from last month's daily logs.
    - "Does it matter if this never gets done?" If not, obsolete. 
  - Copy remaining items from last month's daily logs to monthly log.
  - Check the future log for items to add to the monthly log.
  - What do you want to get done this month? Write it on the right page in your monthly log.
